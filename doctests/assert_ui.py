"""Assertions for keystore_ui's accounts tree.

Two halves, and the split is the point.

Section 0 opens no socket and needs no app: `--grep-only` runs it alone. It covers the claims
a source file can answer for — which Theme tokens exist, which strings reach an AutoText
control, which controls were removed — plus doctests/tree_table.mjs, which runs the view's own
src/qml/tree.js against a case table. Every rule that decides which node an account belongs to
and what its badge claims lives in that file precisely so a table can run it: a rule expressed
only as a QML binding can be checked by nothing but a running app, and this screen's defects
were all claims about where an account came from.

Sections 1 and up drive a live app over the QML inspector on port 3768 and are READ-ONLY —
they open sheets and toggle a disclosure, and press no confirm button. Port 3768 is also
Basecamp's inspector port. Only ever point this at a fixture app you started yourself.

Run against a `logos-standalone-app` started with QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen and
QML_INSPECTOR_PORT=3768, with keystore_module and keystore_ui staged as the -dev variant, and a
keystore holding at least two derivable wallets — the whole subject of this screen is two
wallets whose first accounts sit at the same path.

A source assertion here names the SITE it is about, never a region: asking whether
`Text.PlainText` appears anywhere in a 600-line file is answered by the first item that sets
it, and the item that does not is the one that matters.
